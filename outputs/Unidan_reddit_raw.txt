------------------------------

I legitimately laughed.  There was also a /r/crowjerk created, which I particularly enjoyed.

Mainly the submission stuff, I suppose?  Trying to get stuff out of the new queue to get some attention is a pain at times, as for comments, mainly my own hot-headedness against misinformation?

It doesn't make it right, but that's the reasoning, at least.

I legitimately just tried to post this under the other account, but maybe I was logged in under my usual and it's been unbanned?  Not sure, I'll wait to hear from the admins.

I don't see why not!  

If the admins feel like they want to give me a second chance, I'll go back to it, but it's just numbers on the other account.  The real thing that I enjoy is talking with people, teaching and having fun on the site, and I can do that regardless of username.

[Follow Willy's comments to various people, it's pretty good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/22mev5/wear_safety_equipment/cgobgnn?context=1)

C'mon, man, it's not like there's a gigantic, bold, fire-engine red sign that says "DON'T PUT THE PUNCHLINE IN THE FREAKING TITLE" directly above where you put the title, right?  

Cut the guy some *slack.*

Generally, but I was already doxxed well before the talk, which is why I was less hesitant about doing it.

TEDx talk doesn't pay anything, it's voluntary if they ask you to do one, though I got wined and dined, which was nice.  The funding we raised for the crow project was about 6k.

I use all of those except ooVoo, which I've never heard of until now, haha.

I'm a fan of flying foxes and pangolins, I suppose?

Well, silverfish break things down, too, so we're about even. :D

By asking this, I feel like you're still going to fall short.

Counter-question: what do humans contribute to the world?

Haha, I'd rather not link it here and essentially doxx myself, but it's one of the top searches on YouTube, it's not hard to find.  I'll send you a PM.

I had a comment about a sandwich that I made, haha, it's very bizarre.

Also, yup, a TEDx talk, though, not a full TED.

Thanks, always appreciate the kind words! :)

Nope, though a Reddit comment of mine is being adapted into a short movie!  

I *have* been in a music video though.  I'm making out with someone in the crowd, but it's pretty hard to see, unfortunately/fortunately.

After writing in this thread for eight hours, yes.

Seems to be about the same as the others, looks like most of them in the neighborhood were used as woodlots, so lots of double-trunk trees, pits and mounds from trees falling over time, but nothing too crazy, relatively level and the whole neighborhood is actually relatively *high* in relation to the rest of the town.

There's a whole bunch of them throughout the neighborhood, but I've just noticed that it's *only* this one, which is odd.

Just have sex on a pile of wet quartz watches, it's similar.

[And yet you still call me names!](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2c31hk/unidan_gets_mad_about_crows_and_jackdaws_in_an/cjbm9im?context=3) :(

Nah, I don't think so, I've turned down a bunch of offers for stuff that's a bit "shill-y" to me already.  I don't endorse or do anything with the account unless it's for charity, a science project that delivers results or education, I try not to do anything that solely benefits me.

Haha, don't worry, in real life, I'm a horrifying husk of a person.

It is, but still: capitalize and italicize, son.

What was embarrassing about it?

Well, I'd done a solo AMA prior to that.  And how dare you question Dr. Fancypant's credentials.

Haha, I love it.  

If people want to say mean stuff about me, just say it to my face if it's what you think, who cares?  I should be able to defend myself though! :D

If anyone is considering me a genius, they should really reconsider.

Haha, fresh corn would probably be fine.  You can get chicken feed, too, or feed them grass.  They also make pellets for geese that work, too!

It's *Homo sapiens*, you son of a bitch.  

Get your italics and capitals right, and, by the way, they call it *bi*nomial nomenclature for a god damned reason.

Oooh, one of my colleagues did work on Scrub Jays and had the same thing happen, he was furious.

It's darkly funny, I guess?  Someone out there is so upset about me educating people and posting photos of birds on a website that they take the time out of the day to threaten my life via the USPS?

The one's I've gotten usually say they're going to slit my throat and rape my SO, typically.

I already did, and it's already been explained!

Haha, that's a circlejerk sub, though, I knew what I was getting into.

Hey, fair enough, you're entitled to your own opinions.

Right, I get that, and that's generally wrong, saying things are in the crow family and calling anything *in that* a crow would lead you to call things like blue jays "crows," which no one does.  

Then it basically got into what "level" we're talking about, and if you assume people don't know the levels and then disavow your own knowledge, sure, you can call anything a crow in ignorance, so yeah, I agree, it eventually just becomes a stupid argument, but well, here we are.

I had just assumed he wouldn't try to be sneaky about it.

I say it *much* more often than that, don't worry.

I almost never tell people that, really, if anything, I'm pretty nice to laypeople, I think.  I'm also pretty quick to admit when I'm wrong and I've done so a *lot* on Reddit without being a dick about it.

Maybe you're thinking of someone else?  If I've come off that way, I genuinely apologize, because I usually try to be civil if the other person is, and I rarely condescend unless someone else is being rude.

Did you see the one about the guy arguing with me about how I should sharpen a machete?

*That* was petty.

It needs piercing and sucking mouthparts, man, and it better be a Hemipteran :(

Is there something *funny* about birds?  

I suppose you find something funny about the Woodcock, the Southern Screamer, the Blue Booby, the Imperial Shag, or the Tufted Titmouse, too, *huh?*

***ANYTHING FUNNY ABOUT THOSE, GIGGLE MAN?***

*Didn't think so!*

Sure, and I agree with you, I just didn't see that as the point of what he was saying.  For the entire Corvidae family, though, you mainly hear the term 'corvid', not crow, while in the genus, you rarely hear things getting grouped in the way you hear other birds, which is what lead to my initial assumption.

Usually, it is, I love responding to trolls! :D

A lot of people assume that I won't read or respond to stuff, so I've gotten some insanely hateful things sent to me.  Even the last few messages I've gotten here are pretty mean.  

[Here's one from like a minute ago, for example.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2byyca/reddit_helps_me_focus_on_the_important_things/cjbmmq0?context=3)

**EDIT**: Already deleted :(  Man, no one sticks with their insensitivity anymore.

Not really?  Mainly this kind of stuff gets blown out of proportion because I guess I'm decently well-recognized, so people always want to see a popular figure go down in a blaze, it's like watching a train wreck.  I don't really think this is of that caliber, but hey, stay tuned for my inevitable downfall, haha!

I would say the same things in real life, honestly, I don't think anything I said was particularly cruel or over the line, especially considering he started off by being pretty rude to me to begin with out of nowhere. 

It happens, I guess?

Nah, it'd be a bad one, there's no control Unidan :(

Fair enough, if it's a regional thing or colloquialism, that's fine, I'm mainly annoyed that he's trying to be "specific" and insisting on a *less* specific term! :D

This is generally why the Latin is a good way to deal with stuff, it's a common ground, rather than relying on commonalities to a specific country.

No sweat, I think a lot of people just forget there's a person reading all the crap that gets sent to the username :D

Right, the proper term for a member of the family Corvidae is "corvid."  I was under the assumption, which could be wrong, that he was saying that the *species* of Jackdaw is equivalent to *species* of crows, which isn't correct.  

The genus, *Corvus*, which is nested in the family Corvidae, is sometimes called "crows", and part of the argument seemed to be bending the idea that *that* was what he was referring to, but I don't really think so.  At that level, jackdaws are jackdaws, crows are crows, ravens are ravens, and no one really uses them interchangeably.  

In the actual thread that we're referring to with the GIF, people generally thought the bird was a literal crow, at the species level, with a lot of people posting stuff relating to New Caledonian crows, American crows, etc.  That's where my correction came in at the very top, which was to point out that it wasn't any of those, but, rather, a common jackdaw.  

He came in saying essentially, as I interpreted it, they're the same thing, which depends on your grouping.  Basically, he's saying he meant a higher level grouping, while I assume he meant something more specific.  When I get annoyed in the thread is when he claims he wants to be specific, but still insists on the more vague grouping.

Vargas and I used to date the same guy.

You build up a thicker skin, I suppose?  

Most of the stuff people say to me on here is stuff they would never, ever say to someone in real life, so I usually take it with a grain of salt, people hide behind anonymity as it's not tied to their real self, or so they assume.

Sometimes I'll confront people on it and they'll change their tune if they realize they were way over the line, but most of the time it's just punches in the dark, I guess?

It can go either way, generally it's fine, but if anything gets big enough attention, I start getting mean PMs and messages and stuff out of the blue.  I've gotten a few from this thread already, haha.

More, if you could the lesser emergents on the 3-5-7 year cycles!

Really more of a bolding and italics match, but hey, when you're right, you're right.

Ravens are larger, have a larger bill, more evident hackle feathers, deeper call, different tail shape and are generally a bit less social than crows.  They also have more "soaring" flight and do more acrobatics than crows do.

What the heck did you just flippin' say about me, you little undergrad? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at UCSD, and I’ve been involved in numerous field expeditions in Iceland, and I have over 300 confirmed whale sightings. I am trained in gorillas and I’m the top birder in the entire National Audubon Society. You are nothing to me but just another Christmas bird count. I will wipe you the fudge out with observations the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my gosh-darn words. You think you can get away with saying that silliness to me over the Internet? Think again, friend. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of researchers across the USA and your lat-long is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, buddy. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your research. You’re so scooped, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can scoop you in over seven hundred journals, and that’s just with my own research money. Not only am I extensively trained in unfunded proposals, but I have access to the entire JSTOR catalog and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable tushie off the face of the continent, you little squirt. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your dang tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you silly goose. I will peer-review all over you and you will drown in it. Your impact factor is gone, kiddo.

Good times, we actually just had dinner!

* Yup, I don't see why not, they go for raw peanuts pretty hard.

* The fireworks can work sometimes, but unless you keep it up, they'll just come back, they don't care after a while.

* Sure, [here's a link to the AMA with my research group.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wac0p/howdy_unidan_here_with_five_much_better/)

That's just how I talk, haha!

***Haha!***

Man, why are you so upset?  Relax!

TEDx talk, and yup, plus there was also the thread that came about from the April Fools prank, but I'm not sure if that was SRD or not.

* Don't pee in the popcorn.

* Thanks!

* Nah, I felt like I had a good point.

No clue, I think if anyone gets attention, good or bad, there's just whacky people out there.  I generally think it's just people taking a joke too far, but I'm not sure!

It's just weird to have to deal with, I guess.  I don't mind it too much myself, but I'd rather spare my family and friends the hassle.

Nice!  

Those are hooded crows, I believe!

No worries, I actually appreciate people understanding this difference, I've gotten a lot of shit for it, called a hypocrite repeatedly because people think I have no right to privacy once the information is out there.

Pretty much, it's all due to the fact that most people recognize crows, so anything they're in gets called "crows."  It's generally a misunderstanding.

Nah, this is nothing compared to the *other* SRD thread about getting doxxed, I had people yelling at me that I had no right to privacy and releasing all my family information, phone numbers, addresses and that stuff.

*That* was drama.

American crows roost communally in the winter, so that's likely what you're seeing.  They usually congregate in similar spots from year to year, so unless they're super disturbed at the spot, they'll come back to the same location.

You're doing fine!  I generally don't respond to summons in here because there's plenty of other experts and people who are more than capable of answering the questions.

I get what you're saying and I suppose that'd just me being US-centric, as if you call something a crow here, you're almost invariably referring to an actual crow.  There's American crows and fish crows, and almost all of them that you see are generally American crows.  

As someone who works in that field, I have never, nor have I heard *any other corvid scientist* point at a bird that wasn't an actual *crow* such as a raven or jackdaw, and call it one.  

If that was his initial intent, then apologies, but I am very confident that wasn't the case.  Either way, it's a misunderstanding, and to confuse the two is something that I wouldn't expect most people to avoid easily.  

The point is: I made a Morpheus meme and some guy decided to curse and make my observation *more* vague, which is odd.  If you saw the actual thread that the reference is to, you'll see that people thought it was an actual crow, namely the New Caledonian crow, in most cases.

Forest patch at this cross street has had fog on it at night for the last week, but not anywhere else in the neighborhood! Any ideas?

Is it odd to anyone else that the devs made the wireframes so detailed when they're not even seen beneath the meshes?

Found these in a Costa Rican forest near Cerro de la Muerte. Any ideas? Sorry for the somewhat unhelpful photo!

Can't we all just take a minute to remember how wonderful salt water taffy is?

You don't really believe that, do you?

White-tailed deer distributions
Took measurements to see distribution of white-tailed deer and their promixity to certain tree species.  They certainly seem to be drawn to Eastern hemlocks!  

Calculated expected values by frequency noted in prior estimations for the entire forest.

**CATEGORIES**: Beech, Hemlock, Red Oak, Sugar Maple, Red Maple, Miscellaneous (Sweet birch, black cherry, etc, very little data collected for these trees, lumped to make Chi-square calculations more feasible)

χ² = 146.0440408 (p<0.001***)

Shows incredible preference for Eastern hemlocks, likely due to temperature differentials.  Noticed deeper part of forest has high density of hemlocks, but very difficult to navigate and trails not very well established.  Might try to get photos.

Winter field season looks like it's at a close, time to start the spring and summer season!

Hey guys, thank you /r/atheism for helping us promote our AMA, we're glad to take any questions you guys have!

[Here's the link to the AMA, see you there!](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2058f5/unidan_here_with_a_team_of_evolutionary/)

Unidan here with a team of evolutionary biologists who are collaborating on "Great Adaptations," a children's book about evolution! Ask Us Anything! (xpost /r/science)

I'm with a group of evolutionary biologists and we're doing an AMA in /r/science right now, feel free to swing on by!

Unidan here with a team of evolutionary biologists who are collaborating on "Great Adaptations," a children's book about evolution! Ask Us Anything!
Thank you /r/science and its moderators for letting us be a part of your Science AMA series!  Once again, I'm humbled to be allowed to collaborate with people much, much greater than myself, and I'm extremely happy to bring this project to Reddit, so I think this will be a lot of fun!

Please feel free to ask us anything at all, whether it be about evolution or our individual fields of study, and we'd be glad to give you an answer!  Everyone will be here at 1 PM EST to answer questions, but we'll try to answer some earlier and then throughout the day after that.

"Great Adaptations" is a children's book which aims to explain evolutionary adaptations in a fun and easy way. It will contain ten stories, each one written by author and evolutionary biologist Dr. Tiffany Taylor, who is working with each scientist to best relate their research and how it ties in to evolutionary concepts. Even better, each story is illustrated by a wonderful dream team of artists including James Monroe, Zach Wienersmith (from SMBC comics) and many more!

For parents or sharp kids who want to know more about the research talked about in the story, each scientist will also provide a short commentary on their work within the book, too!

Today we're joined by:

* Dr. Tiffany Taylor (tiffanyevolves), Post-Doctoral Research Fellow and evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading in the UK. She has done her research in the field of genetics, and is the author of "Great Adaptations" who will be working with the scientists to relate their research to the kids!

* Dr. David Sloan Wilson (davidswilson), Distinguished Professor at Binghamton University in the Departments of Biological Sciences and Anthropology who works on the evolution of altruism.

* Dr. Niels Dingemanse (dingemanse), joining us from the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany, a researcher in the ecology of variation, who will be writing a section on personalities in birds.

* Ben Eisenkop (Unidan), from Binghamton University, an ecosystem ecologist working on his PhD concerning nitrogen biogeochemical cycling.

We'll also be joined intermittently by Robert Kadar (evolutionbob), an evolution advocate who came up with the idea of "Great Adaptations" and Baba Brinkman (Baba_Brinkman), a Canadian rapper who has weaved evolution and other ideas into his performances.  One of our artists, Zach Weinersmith (MrWeiner) will also be joining us when he can!

Special thanks to /r/atheism and /r/dogecoin for helping us promote this AMA, too!  If you're interested in donating to our cause via dogecoin, we've set up an address at DSzGRTzrWGB12DUB6hmixQmS8QD4GsAJY2 which will be applied to the Kickstarter manually, as they do not accept the coin directly.

**EDIT: ~~Over seven hours in and still going strong!  Wonderful questions so far, keep 'em coming!~~**

**EDIT 2: Over ten hours in and still answering, really great questions and comments thus far!**
